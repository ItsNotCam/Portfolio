I developed a **fully responsive** website from the ground up, taking charge of both the **design and development processes**

Using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/nkOThbhroZHoa0L8h44F5v/Portfolio-v2?node-id=0-1&t=CStSfkEl6lqHiOzJ-0), I created the design of the site to streamline the development process. 

The website is built with **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**, leveraging the power of **TailwindCSS** to create a modern and maintainable codebase."
